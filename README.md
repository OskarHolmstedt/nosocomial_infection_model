# Nosocomial infection model

## Project title

Outbreak reconstruction for nosocomial infections

## Description

Developing a method for inferring transmission chains in a hospital setting using Bayesian statistics. Developing a model for simulating infectious disease outbreaks in a hospital setting. Apply the statistical method to both simulated data and real hospital data.
